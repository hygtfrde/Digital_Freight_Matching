# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Digital Freight Matching system currently has individual demo files for each business requirement, but lacks a comprehensive testing suite that uses realistic test data to demonstrate both successful route generation and scenarios where requests would not generate profitable routes. This feature will enhance the existing demo and testing capabilities by incorporating the structured test data from `tests/test_routes/test_data.json` into a unified demonstration system that showcases the full range of system behaviors.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Unified Demo Testing Framework

**User Story:** As a system evaluator, I want a comprehensive demo testing framework that uses realistic test data to demonstrate both successful and unsuccessful route matching scenarios, so that I can understand the full capabilities and limitations of the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the demo tests THEN the system SHALL use the structured test data from `tests/test_routes/test_data.json`
2. WHEN processing test orders THEN the system SHALL demonstrate successful route generation for profitable matches
3. WHEN encountering unprofitable scenarios THEN the system SHALL clearly show why certain requests are rejected
4. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL provide detailed explanations for both success and failure cases
5. WHEN completing the demo THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive report showing system performance across all test scenarios

### Requirement 2: Realistic Test Data Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the demo system to use realistic test data that represents actual logistics scenarios, so that the demonstrations accurately reflect real-world system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading test data THEN the system SHALL parse all 11 test orders from `test_data.json`
2. WHEN processing cargo data THEN the system SHALL handle different package counts, weights, and cargo types (general, hazmat)
3. WHEN calculating distances THEN the system SHALL use the actual latitude/longitude coordinates provided in the test data
4. WHEN validating orders THEN the system SHALL apply all business constraints (proximity, capacity, time, profitability) to the test data
5. WHEN categorizing results THEN the system SHALL identify which orders would be profitable vs unprofitable

### Requirement 3: Success and Failure Scenario Demonstration

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want to see clear examples of both successful route generation and scenarios where the system correctly rejects unprofitable requests, so that I can understand the system's decision-making process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN demonstrating successful scenarios THEN the system SHALL show profitable route matches with detailed profitability calculations
2. WHEN demonstrating failure scenarios THEN the system SHALL explain specific reasons for rejection (distance, capacity, profitability, etc.)
3. WHEN displaying constraint violations THEN the system SHALL show which business rules were violated and by how much
4. WHEN calculating profitability THEN the system SHALL show the financial impact of accepting vs rejecting each order
5. WHEN presenting results THEN the system SHALL categorize orders into clear success/failure groups with explanations

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Reporting and Analytics

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want detailed reporting on the demo test results that shows system performance metrics and decision patterns, so that I can assess system effectiveness and identify areas for improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide success/failure ratios across all test scenarios
2. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL show processing times for each order evaluation
3. WHEN calculating metrics THEN the system SHALL display average profitability improvements and constraint compliance rates
4. WHEN identifying patterns THEN the system SHALL highlight common reasons for order rejection
5. WHEN presenting analytics THEN the system SHALL provide visual summaries of test results and system performance

### Requirement 5: Integration with Existing Demo Framework

**User Story:** As a user, I want the enhanced demo testing to integrate seamlessly with the existing demo and CLI systems, so that I can access comprehensive testing capabilities through familiar interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the demo system THEN the enhanced testing SHALL be available through the existing CLI menu
2. WHEN running demos THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing demo functions
3. WHEN generating output THEN the system SHALL use consistent formatting and styling with existing demos
4. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL provide the same level of error handling and user feedback as existing demos
5. WHEN saving results THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing data persistence and reporting mechanisms
