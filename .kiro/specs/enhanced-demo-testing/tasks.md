  - Add `display_test_progress()` method to show real-time progress during test execution
  - Create `export_results()` method to save test results and reports to files
  - Integrate with existing CLI styling and error handling patterns
  - Test CLI integration to ensure compatibility with existing menu system
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

- [ ] 6. Implement comprehensive testing and validation
  - Write integration tests to validate end-to-end demo execution with all 11 test orders
  - Create performance tests to ensure demo completes within 30 seconds and processes orders under 2 seconds each
  - Add validation tests to verify success/failure categorization accuracy against expected outcomes
  - Implement error handling tests for malformed JSON data and processing failures
  - Create CLI integration tests to verify menu functionality and user interaction
  - Add regression tests to ensure existing demo functionality remains intact
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 1.5, 2.4, 2.5_

- [ ] 7. Create documentation and examples
