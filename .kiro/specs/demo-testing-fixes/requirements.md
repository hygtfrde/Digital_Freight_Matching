# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Digital Freight Matching system has comprehensive demo tests in the `tests/demo_reqs_tests/` directory that validate the 6 core business requirements. However, these tests are currently failing due to missing dependencies, import issues, and compatibility problems with the current codebase. This feature will fix all demo testing failures to ensure the business requirement validation system works correctly and can be used to demonstrate system capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Dependency Resolution and Environment Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all demo tests to have the correct dependencies installed and configured, so that the tests can run without import errors or missing module failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running demo tests THEN the system SHALL have all required dependencies (sqlmodel, pydantic, pytest) properly installed
2. WHEN importing database modules THEN the system SHALL successfully import SQLModel, Field, Relationship, and other database components
3. WHEN importing schema modules THEN the system SHALL successfully import Order, Route, Truck, Location, Cargo, Package, and CargoType classes
4. WHEN importing the OrderProcessor THEN the system SHALL successfully import and instantiate the OrderProcessor class
5. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL not fail due to missing module errors

### Requirement 2: Database Connection and Data Access Fixes

**User Story:** As a test runner, I want the demo tests to properly connect to the database and access test data, so that the tests can validate business requirements using real system data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests access the database THEN the system SHALL successfully connect to the SQLite database
2. WHEN tests query for routes THEN the system SHALL return valid route data with proper location relationships
3. WHEN tests query for trucks THEN the system SHALL return valid truck data with capacity and type information
4. WHEN tests query for locations THEN the system SHALL return valid location data with latitude and longitude coordinates
5. WHEN tests create schema objects from database data THEN the system SHALL properly convert database models to schema objects

### Requirement 3: OrderProcessor Integration and Validation Fixes

**User Story:** As a business requirement validator, I want the OrderProcessor to work correctly with the demo tests, so that business constraints can be properly validated and demonstrated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests instantiate OrderProcessor THEN the system SHALL create a valid processor with proper constants
2. WHEN tests call validate_order_for_route THEN the system SHALL return proper ProcessingResult objects
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with ValidationError objects
4. WHEN validation succeeds THEN the system SHALL indicate success with proper metrics
5. WHEN tests check specific constraints THEN the system SHALL properly validate proximity, capacity, time, and cargo compatibility

### Requirement 4: Test Data Structure and Schema Compatibility

**User Story:** As a test developer, I want the test data structures to be compatible with the current schema definitions, so that tests can create valid Order, Cargo, Package, and Location objects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests create Order objects THEN the system SHALL accept the current Order schema structure
2. WHEN tests create Cargo objects THEN the system SHALL properly handle the cargo-package relationship
3. WHEN tests create Package objects THEN the system SHALL validate volume, weight, and CargoType fields
4. WHEN tests create Location objects THEN the system SHALL accept latitude and longitude coordinates
5. WHEN tests convert between database and schema objects THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity

### Requirement 5: Pydantic Configuration and Deprecation Fixes

**User Story:** As a system maintainer, I want to resolve Pydantic deprecation warnings and configuration issues, so that the tests run cleanly without warnings and are compatible with current Pydantic versions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run THEN the system SHALL not generate Pydantic deprecation warnings about class-based config
2. WHEN schema objects are created THEN the system SHALL use ConfigDict instead of deprecated Config classes
3. WHEN from_attributes is used THEN the system SHALL properly configure ORM mode for database integration
4. WHEN validation occurs THEN the system SHALL use current Pydantic V2 patterns and methods
5. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL show clean output without deprecation warnings

### Requirement 6: Test Execution and Reporting Improvements

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want the demo tests to execute successfully and provide clear reporting on business requirement validation, so that I can verify system compliance and demonstrate capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running individual demo tests THEN each test SHALL complete successfully without errors
2. WHEN running all demo tests THEN the test suite SHALL execute all 6 business requirements plus 2 bonus requirements
3. WHEN tests validate proximity constraints THEN the system SHALL demonstrate 1km proximity enforcement
4. WHEN tests validate capacity constraints THEN the system SHALL demonstrate volume and weight limit enforcement
5. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL provide clear pass/fail reporting with detailed explanations

### Requirement 7: Integration with Enhanced Demo Testing Framework

**User Story:** As a system evaluator, I want the fixed demo tests to integrate with the enhanced demo testing framework, so that I can run comprehensive demonstrations using both individual requirement tests and the structured test data approach.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN enhanced demo testing is available THEN the fixed demo tests SHALL be compatible with the new framework
2. WHEN running comprehensive demos THEN the system SHALL use both individual requirement validation and structured test data
3. WHEN presenting results THEN the system SHALL combine outputs from both testing approaches
4. WHEN validating business requirements THEN the system SHALL provide consistent results across both testing methods
5. WHEN demonstrating system capabilities THEN the system SHALL show both successful and failed scenarios clearly
