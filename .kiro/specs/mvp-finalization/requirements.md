# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Digital Freight Matching (DFM) system has reached a functional MVP state with core business logic implemented, database management consolidated, and OSMnx integration partially complete. This feature focuses on finalizing the MVP by creating comprehensive documentation for users and evaluators, conducting thorough testing against business requirements, and cleaning up the codebase to ensure maintainability and eliminate redundant components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Business Requirements Validation

**User Story:** As a project evaluator, I want to verify that the system meets all stated business requirements from the engineering lab specification, so that I can assess the project's completeness and effectiveness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating the system THEN it SHALL demonstrate conversion of the $388.15 daily loss into measurable profit through order matching
2. WHEN processing orders THEN the system SHALL enforce the 1km proximity constraint for pickup and dropoff locations
3. WHEN managing capacity THEN the system SHALL respect the 48mÂ³ truck capacity and 9,180 lbs weight limits per the business requirements
4. WHEN calculating routes THEN the system SHALL maintain the 10-hour maximum route time including 15-minute stops and break requirements
5. WHEN handling contract obligations THEN the system SHALL preserve all 5 existing routes to Ringgold, Augusta, Savannah, Albany, and Columbus

### Requirement 2: Comprehensive Documentation

**User Story:** As a user or evaluator, I want clear, comprehensive documentation that explains how to use the system and understand its capabilities, so that I can effectively operate and assess the Digital Freight Matching system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing documentation THEN the system SHALL provide a complete user guide with setup, operation, and troubleshooting instructions
2. WHEN evaluating the project THEN the system SHALL include technical documentation explaining architecture, algorithms, and design decisions
3. WHEN learning the system THEN the documentation SHALL include examples of order processing, route optimization, and profitability calculations
4. WHEN deploying the system THEN the documentation SHALL provide clear installation and configuration instructions with dependency management

### Requirement 3: System Integration Testing

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive integration tests that validate end-to-end functionality, so that I can ensure the system works correctly in real-world scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running integration tests THEN the system SHALL validate complete order-to-route matching workflows
2. WHEN testing business logic THEN the system SHALL verify profitability calculations match expected results from the business requirements
3. WHEN validating constraints THEN the system SHALL test proximity, capacity, time, and cargo compatibility enforcement
4. WHEN testing data integrity THEN the system SHALL verify database operations maintain consistency and prevent corruption

### Requirement 4: Performance and Reliability Assessment

**User Story:** As a logistics manager, I want to understand the system's performance characteristics and reliability, so that I can make informed decisions about production deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing orders THEN the system SHALL complete order matching within acceptable time limits (< 5 seconds per order)
2. WHEN handling multiple orders THEN the system SHALL demonstrate batch processing capabilities without performance degradation
3. WHEN encountering errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and graceful failure handling
4. WHEN operating continuously THEN the system SHALL maintain stable performance over extended periods

### Requirement 5: Codebase Cleanup and Refactoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean, maintainable codebase with no redundant or unused components, so that future development and maintenance are efficient and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN it SHALL contain no duplicate functionality or redundant implementations
2. WHEN examining files THEN the system SHALL have no unused scripts, imports, or dead code
3. WHEN following code organization THEN the system SHALL maintain clear separation of concerns with consistent naming conventions
4. WHEN updating the system THEN the codebase SHALL follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles throughout

### Requirement 6: Evaluation and Demonstration Readiness

**User Story:** As a project evaluator, I want a system that clearly demonstrates its value proposition and technical capabilities, so that I can assess the project's success against the engineering lab objectives.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN demonstrating the system THEN it SHALL show clear before/after profitability improvements for the 5 contract routes
2. WHEN presenting capabilities THEN the system SHALL demonstrate order matching, route optimization, and capacity management features
3. WHEN evaluating technical merit THEN the system SHALL showcase integration of multiple technologies (FastAPI, SQLModel, OSMnx, etc.)
4. WHEN assessing business value THEN the system SHALL provide metrics and analytics that quantify operational improvements

### Requirement 7: Production Readiness Assessment

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want to understand what would be required to deploy this system in a production environment, so that I can plan for real-world implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assessing deployment THEN the system SHALL identify production requirements including infrastructure, security, and scalability needs
2. WHEN planning implementation THEN the system SHALL document known limitations and areas for future enhancement
3. WHEN considering operations THEN the system SHALL provide monitoring and maintenance guidelines
4. WHEN evaluating costs THEN the system SHALL include analysis of operational costs versus projected savings
