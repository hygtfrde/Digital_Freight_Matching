## dashboard_menu_cli.py
- CLI menu program with solutions and features (currently stubbed for moth methods)

System Configuration

What is Missing or Only Partially Covered:

Locations, Packages, Cargo:
There are no explicit menus or actions for these entities in your DFMDashboard.
If you want full dashboard coverage as per your matrix, you would need to add:

Menus and stub actions for Locations (list/add/edit/delete/view)
Menus and stub actions for Packages (list/add/edit/delete/assign)
Menus and stub actions for Cargo (list/add/edit/delete/assign)
Assign Truck/Assign to Cargo/Assign Packages:
Not exposed as a top-level menu action.

Clients:
You use create_crud_menu("clients",...), which may provide full CRUD, but it's not shown in detail in this snippet.
