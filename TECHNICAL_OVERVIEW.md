# Digital Freight Matching System - Technical Overview

## Executive Summary

The Digital Freight Matching System (DFM) is a logistics optimization platform that converts unprofitable truck routes into profitable ones by intelligently matching third-party freight orders to existing route capacity. The system transforms a daily loss of $388.15 across 5 contract routes into measurable profit through automated order consolidation and route optimization.

## Business Problem & Solution

### The Challenge
**Infinity and Beyond Logistics** faces a critical profitability issue:
- 5 binding contract routes losing $388.15/day collectively
- Underutilized truck capacity (48m³ per truck)
- Fixed route commitments that cannot be cancelled
- Need to fill empty space with profitable third-party orders

### The Solution
Our DFM system provides:
- **Intelligent Order Matching**: Automatically finds compatible orders for existing routes
- **Capacity Optimization**: Maximizes truck utilization while respecting constraints
- **Profitability Analysis**: Real-time P&L tracking and business requirement validation
- **Route Preservation**: Maintains all contract obligations while adding profitable cargo

## Technical Implementation Details

### Order Matching Algorithm

The core matching algorithm uses a multi-stage filtering and scoring system:

```python
def match_orders_to_routes(orders: List[Order], routes: List[Route]) -> Dict[Route, List[Order]]:
    """
    Stage 1: Geographic Filtering
    - Filter orders within 1km of route path using Haversine distance calculation
    - Use spatial indexing for performance optimization
    
    Stage 2: Capacity Validation  
    - Check volume constraints (≤48m³ per truck)
    - Validate weight limits (≤9180 lbs per truck)
    - Account for existing cargo loads
    
    Stage 3: Time Window Analysis
    - Ensure pickup/delivery fits within 10-hour route limit
    - Add 15-minute stop time per order (pickup + delivery)
    - Optimize stop sequence to minimize total time
    
    Stage 4: Revenue Optimization
    - Score orders by revenue per cubic meter
    - Prioritize high-value, compact cargo
    - Balance load distribution across available trucks
    """
```

### Business Requirement Validation

The system continuously validates 5 critical business requirements:

#### Requirement 1.1: Profitability Conversion
```python
def validate_profitability_requirements(routes: List[Route], baseline_loss: float = 388.15):
    """
    Validates conversion of $388.15 daily loss into measurable profit
    
    Metrics Tracked:
    - Current daily profit/loss per route
    - Total system profitability improvement
    - Revenue per cubic meter utilization
    - Profit margin trends over time
    """
```

#### Requirement 1.2: Proximity Constraint (1km)
```python
def validate_proximity_constraint(orders: List[Order], routes: List[Route]):
    """
    Ensures all matched orders are within 1km of route path
    
    Implementation:
    - Haversine formula for accurate distance calculation
    - Spatial buffering around route coordinates
    - Real-time validation during order assignment
    """
```

#### Requirement 1.3: Capacity Limits (48m³, 9180 lbs)
```python
def validate_capacity_constraints(orders: List[Order], trucks: List[Truck]):
    """
    Enforces strict capacity limits for all trucks
    
    Validation Logic:
    - Volume: Sum of all package volumes ≤ 48m³
    - Weight: Sum of all package weights ≤ 9180 lbs (4164 kg)
    - Load balancing across multiple trucks when needed
    """
```

#### Requirement 1.4: Time Constraints (10 hours max)
```python
def validate_time_constraints(routes: List[Route]):
    """
    Maintains 10-hour maximum route time including stops
    
    Time Calculation:
    - Base driving time using route distance and speed
    - Stop time: 15 minutes × 2 stops × number of orders
    - Buffer time for traffic and loading delays
    """
```

#### Requirement 1.5: Contract Route Preservation
```python
def validate_contract_compliance(routes: List[Route]):
    """
    Ensures all 5 contract routes are preserved
    
    Contract Routes:
    1. Atlanta → Ringgold (202 miles)
    2. Atlanta → Augusta (189.2 miles)  
    3. Atlanta → Savannah (496 miles)
    4. Atlanta → Albany (364 miles)
    5. Atlanta → Columbus (214 miles)
    """
```

### Database Schema & Relationships

#### Core Entity Design
```sql
-- Simplified schema representation
CREATE TABLE clients (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    contact_info JSON
);

CREATE TABLE locations (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    lat DECIMAL(10,8) NOT NULL,
    lng DECIMAL(11,8) NOT NULL,
    address TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    client_id INTEGER REFERENCES clients(id),
    location_origin_id INTEGER REFERENCES locations(id),
    location_destiny_id INTEGER REFERENCES locations(id),
    pickup_time DATETIME,
    delivery_time DATETIME,
    status VARCHAR DEFAULT 'pending'
);

CREATE TABLE routes (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    location_origin_id INTEGER REFERENCES locations(id),
    location_destiny_id INTEGER REFERENCES locations(id),
    distance_miles DECIMAL(8,2),
    estimated_time_hours DECIMAL(4,2),
    profitability DECIMAL(10,2)
);

CREATE TABLE trucks (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    capacity DECIMAL(6,2) NOT NULL, -- m³
    autonomy DECIMAL(8,2), -- miles
    type VARCHAR NOT NULL
);
```

#### Advanced Relationships
```python
# Many-to-Many: Orders ↔ Routes (through route assignments)
# One-to-Many: Route → Orders (orders assigned to route)
# One-to-Many: Order → Cargo → Packages (cargo composition)
# Many-to-One: Routes → Trucks (truck assignments)
```
