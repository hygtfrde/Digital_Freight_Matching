Business Requirements Validation Framework

This module validates that the Digital Freight Matching system meets all 
business requirements from the engineering lab specification.

Key Requirements Validated:
1. Profitability improvement ($388.15 daily loss target)
2. 1km proximity constraint enforcement
3. Capacity limits (48mÂ³ volume, 9180 lbs weight)
4. Time limits (10-hour maximum route time)
5. Contract route preservation (5 existing routes)
