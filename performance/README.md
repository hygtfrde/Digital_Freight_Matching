# Performance Assessment and Monitoring System

## Overview

This directory contains the comprehensive performance assessment and monitoring system for the Digital Freight Matching (DFM) system. The implementation addresses requirements 4.1-4.4 of the MVP finalization specification.

## Components

### 1. PerformanceAssessor (`performance_assessor.py`)

The main performance assessment class that provides:

- **Performance Profiling**: Measures execution time, memory usage, and CPU usage for order processing operations
- **Load Testing**: Concurrent testing with configurable users and operations per user
- **Memory Monitoring**: Real-time memory usage tracking with leak detection
- **Benchmark Testing**: Comparison against baseline performance metrics with regression detection
- **Performance Reporting**: Comprehensive report generation with compliance checking

### 2. Performance Test Runner (`performance_test_runner.py`)

A comprehensive test runner that:

- Executes all performance assessment capabilities
- Generates detailed reports for system evaluation
- Provides compliance checking against business requirements
- Saves results to JSON files for analysis

### 3. Performance Regression Tests (`tests/performance/test_performance_regression.py`)

Automated regression testing suite that:

- Tests single order processing performance (< 5 seconds requirement)
- Validates batch processing capabilities without degradation
- Ensures consistent performance over time
- Monitors memory stability and leak detection
- Validates error handling performance

## Key Features

### Performance Profiling
- Execution time measurement with millisecond precision
- Memory usage tracking (RSS memory)
- CPU usage calculation
- Success/failure tracking with detailed error reporting

### Load Testing
- Concurrent user simulation
- Configurable operations per user
- Throughput measurement (operations per second)
- Error rate calculation
- Resource usage monitoring during load

### Memory Monitoring
- Real-time memory sampling
- Memory leak detection with configurable thresholds
- Garbage collection statistics
- Memory growth pattern analysis
- Timeline tracking for memory usage

### Benchmark Testing
- Baseline performance comparison
- Regression detection (>20% performance degradation)
- Improvement detection (>10% performance improvement)
- Requirements compliance checking
- Automated recommendation generation

## Requirements Compliance

### 4.1: Order Processing Performance
- ✅ Measures execution time for order processing
- ✅ Validates < 5 second requirement per order
- ✅ Tracks success rates and error conditions

### 4.2: Batch Processing Capabilities
- ✅ Tests batch processing without performance degradation
- ✅ Monitors success rates (target: >95%)
- ✅ Validates throughput under load

### 4.3: Error Handling
- ✅ Provides clear error messages for validation failures
- ✅ Implements graceful failure handling
- ✅ Tracks error rates and types

### 4.4: Stable Performance
- ✅ Monitors performance over extended periods
- ✅ Detects memory leaks and resource issues
- ✅ Validates performance consistency

## Usage Examples

### Basic Performance Profiling
```python
from performance.performance_assessor import PerformanceAssessor

assessor = PerformanceAssessor()
metrics = assessor.profile_order_processing(orders, routes, trucks)
print(f"Execution time: {metrics.execution_time_ms}ms")
```

### Load Testing
```python
load_results = assessor.run_load_tests(
    order_generator=create_test_order,
    routes=routes,
    trucks=trucks,
    concurrent_users=10,
    operations_per_user=100
)
```

### Memory Monitoring
```python
memory_report = assessor.monitor_memory_usage(
    duration_seconds=300,
    sample_interval_seconds=1.0
)
```

### Comprehensive Assessment
```python
from performance.performance_test_runner import PerformanceTestRunner

runner = PerformanceTestRunner()
results = runner.run_comprehensive_performance_tests()
runner.print_summary_report(results)
```
